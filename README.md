This was a project done in 2019-2020. The model works with both Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno. The components used were a soil moisture sensor and a DC motor connected to a water reservoir. The Raspberry could be specifically programmed to cater to the specific needs of delicate indoor plants, so the motor can be turned on when the moisture sensor detects a drop in water levels in the soil. As the processes were taking place, the user was notified through SMS with specific time stamps.
