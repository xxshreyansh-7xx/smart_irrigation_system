This project was done in 2019-2020 and has only recently been uploaded to my personal GitHub account. All original files are also present on the shared GitHub account of the collaborators. The model works with both Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno. The components used were a soil moisture sensor and a DC motor connected to a water reservoir. The Raspberry could be specifically programmed to cater to the specific needs of delicate indoor plants, so the motor can be turned on when the moisture sensor detects a drop in water levels in the soil. As the processes were taking place, the user was notified through SMS with specific time stamps.
